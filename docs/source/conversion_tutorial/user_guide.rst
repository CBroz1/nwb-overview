Converting neurophysiology data to NWB
======================================

Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) provides a common self-describing format
ideal for archiving neurophysiology data and sharing it with colleagues.
It provides a schema which helps neuroscientists package their data and
metadata together so that they are both machine- and human-readable, and
reusable to gain additional scientific insights. Converting to NWB is
also a critical step for getting your neurophysiology data in the the
DANDI archive, and allows you to access a number of powerful analysis
and visualization tools. The software tools for creating NWB files are
spread across :ref:`several different tools and repositories<tools-glossary>`.

We understand converting to NWB can be daunting. This guide will walk
you through the tools available to help you convert your neurophysiology
data to NWB. We will start with an overview of NWB and the Python and
MATLAB APIs maintained by the core development team, then discuss
automated tools for converting formats.
