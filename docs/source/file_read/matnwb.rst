Reading and Browsing NWB files with MatNWB
==========================================

MatNWB provides an object-oriented API using standard MATLAB classes to allow for a near-seemless integration with MATLAB's own class system. HDF5's groups, links, and datasets are all mapped over to elided properties, custom "untyped" types, and lower-level MATLAB primitive types.
