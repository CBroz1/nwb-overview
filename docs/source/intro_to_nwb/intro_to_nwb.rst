Intro to NWB
============

Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) provides a common self-describing format
ideal for archiving neurophysiology data and sharing it with colleagues.
It provides a schema which helps neuroscientists package their data and
metadata together so that they are both machine- and human-readable, and
reusable to gain additional scientific insights. The software tools for creating NWB files are
spread across :ref:`several different tools and repositories<tools-glossary>`.
